# raytracer-rs

A fast, educational, multithreaded ray tracer implemented in safe Rust ðŸš€  
Inspired by Peter Shirley's *Ray Tracing in One Weekend* book series.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Scene with spheres, planes, and materials
- Diffuse, metallic, and glassy surfaces
- Recursive ray tracing with multiple bounces
- Anti-aliasing and camera field-of-view
- Full CPU parallelism using `rayon`
- Output in `.ppm` or `.png`

## ðŸ“š Why
Practice Rust through a project involving math, performance, and memory safety â€” ideal for C++ developers transitioning to Rust.

## ðŸš€ Run
```bash
cargo run --release
